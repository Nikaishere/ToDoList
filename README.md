TO Do LIST made with react


## Set up

### Initial

Run `npm install` to install packages.


### For React

`cd react`. Run `npm install` to install packages and `npm start` to run your development build.

The app will run on `http://localhost:3000` as the default port.

## Basic Requirements

Create a to-do list with the following functionality:

- [ ] A list of items.
  - At least three should be prefilled.
- [ ] A form to add new items.
  - After clicking a button and/or hitting enter, the new item should be added to the list.
- [ ] A way to cross out items from the list when it is clicked on.
  - The styling for this is your choice – you can have a color change, a styling change (e.g. strikethrough) or something else. However, it should be clear that the item in the to do list is complete.
